## What is Spectrum?
Refract Studios' game - Distance - comes with no custom code support. Why is this an issue? Suppose you need to fix a game flaw or customize specific behavior. Spectrum enables you to do that by loading a plugin you built. 

After it loads your code, you have complete control over what the game can do - this allows you to create new game's features - either using Spectrum's API or directly using Unity Engine's functions. The possibilities are endless.
