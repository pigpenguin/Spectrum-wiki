Every bug report is an important contribution, because it helps us make Spectrum better. To make sure your bug report is processed quickly, be sure to use the template below.

#### Bug report template

**Bug description:**  
Write the bug description here; i.e. what is happening that shouldn't be and what were you doing when the bug occured. This is a required section.

**Expected behavior:**  
Write the expected behavior here; i.e. what should have happen instead of what actually happened. This is a required section. 

**Screenshots/videos of the bug:**  
This is an optional section. Including screenshots/videos can help us understand the problem better.

**Links to any logs (Spectrum/Distance):**  
This is an optional section, but is *highly recommended*. It can help us approximate the location of the bug's cause, therefore decreasing time needed for fix to be issued.
